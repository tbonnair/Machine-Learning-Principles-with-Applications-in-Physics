To explore that, you can play with the code and tune hyperparameters, add fancy tuning like dropping, weight decay, momentum, or regularization.\n","\n","You can also go and use the full dataset provided in the seminal papers which is in fact made of millions of events, not just $10^5$ that could help your neural network converges to better solutions."],"metadata":{"id":"3TD_5pnQl9T1"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Randomized search for hyperparameter tuning\n","In our examples, we always focus on one hyperparameter at a time. In fact, using scikit-learn you can specify several ranges for your hyperparameters and test them randomly to find the association of parameters using randomized search or grid search cross-validation. Randomized search is more efficient numerically but is not leading you to the best possible set of parameters, while grid search consists in an exhaustive search in your pre-defined ranges for parameters. Here we illustrate it with randomized search."],"metadata":{"id":"dtqfbpt5U8fG"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# @title\n","from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV\n","\n","# define range of values for each hyperparameter\n","hyperparameters_range = [{\n","        \"n_estimators\": [1, 5, 10, 20, 40],       # Number of trees\n","        \"max_features\": [0.5, 1.0, \"sqrt\", \"log2\"],  # Proportion of the features used for training you RFs\n","        \"max_depth\": [5, 10, 15, 20],  # Maximum depth of the trees trained in RFs\n","    }]\n","\n","# Create a base model\n","RF = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=20, max_depth=15, n_jobs=-1)\n","\n","# Random search with cross validation\n","RF_CV = RandomizedSearchCV(\n","    RF, param_distributions=hyperparameters_range, cv=5)\n","\n","# Fit the search\n","RF_CV.fit(X_train, y_train)"],"metadata":{"id":"26KLjHfMtnWZ","cellView":"form"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["You can now select the best model and test it."],"metadata":{"id":"TTWduVq1xKTZ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# @title\n","print(RF_CV.best_params_)         # Prints the best parameters\n","RF_best = RF_CV.best_estimator_   # Select the best model\n","RF_best.score(X_test, y_test)     # Test dataset"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"FsOC4p_nw75x","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1694964808259,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":376,"user":{"displayName":"Tony","userId":"03188807958140873473"}},"outputId":"1dc4e697-9705-4226-a52f-093201fa5ccd","cellView":"form","collapsed":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["{'n_estimators': 40, 'max_features': 'log2', 'max_depth': 10}\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["0.7802"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":133}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["You could do similarly with the [`GridSearchCV`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html) function from scikit-learn to perform grid search cross-validation for tuning your hyperparameters."],"metadata":{"id":"EP-12v-DWDZP"}}]}
